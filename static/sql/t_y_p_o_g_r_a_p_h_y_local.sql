I\'m hoping the heptapods will do the same.\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div>It\'s a strange semester, yes. We\'re remote. We meet each other through this screen where you find me right *now.* Our current reality might pass for science fiction, so perhaps it is a good time to read some, together.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life\">Story of Your Life</a></i> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang\">Ted Chiang</a> would be a good choice. It’s brief and complicated. It’s visual. It’s even typographical. You might already know the plot from its film adaptation in 2016 starring Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)\">Arrival</a></i>. Meanwhile, our story continues.</div><div><br></div><blockquote>Weber looked at the drawing dubiously. \"What would be the advantage of that?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"So far I\'ve been proceeding the way I would with speakers of an unwritten language. Then it occurred to me that the heptapods must have writing, too.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"So?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"If the heptapods have a mechanical way of producing writing, then their writing ought to be very regular, very consistent. That would make it easier for us to identify graphemes instead of phonemes. It\'s like picking out the letters in a printed sentence instead of trying to hear them when the sentence is spoken aloud.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"I take your point,\" he admitted. \"And how would you respond to them? Show them the words they displayed to you?\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div>“Graphemes”? “Phonemes”? Sounds like typography to me. And in fact it is—the story proceeds as a kind of typographic detective story, but instead of whodunnit, this one’s a howdtheydoit. We find out quickly enough that the Heptapods do indeed have a writing system and they also have a spoken language. Here’s a scene from early in the film version when Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) first witnesses the strange handwriting:</div><div><br></div><div>\r\n\r\n<video width=\"100%\" controls=\"\">\r\n  <source src=\"media/00034.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video>\r\n\r\n</div><div><br></div><div>She also records their extraterrestrial voices, and deduces a way to proceed based on a correlation between the two.</div><div><br></div><blockquote>\"Basically. And if they put spaces between words, any sentences we write would be a lot more intelligible than any spoken sentence we might splice together from recordings.\"</blockquote><blockquote>He leaned back in his chair. \"You know we want to show as little of our technology as possible.\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div>Surely.</div><div><br></div><blockquote>\"I understand, but we\'re using machines as intermediaries already. If we can get them to use writing, I believe progress will go much faster than if we\'re restricted to the sound spectrographs.\"</blockquote><blockquote>The colonel turned to Gary. \"Your opinion?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"It sounds like a good idea to me. I\'m curious whether the heptapods might have difficulty reading our monitors. Their looking glasses are based on a completely different technology than our video screens. As far as we can tell, they don\'t use pixels or scan lines, and they don\'t refresh on a frame-by-frame basis.\"</blockquote><div><div><br></div><div>This is an imaginary, or anyway, *conjured* set of digits produced by harnessing a neural network to <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\">a large database of handwritten numbers</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00032.gif\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The glyphs above were never written, but rather they’ve been inferred by a computer program trained to the task.

It evolved through several stages, none of which ever really stuck. <i>Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu</i>, a film directed by David Loeb Weiss, captures one moment in this transition by chronicling the last day of metal typesetting at the <i>New York Times</i> on <a href=\"https://ruk.ca/sites/ruk.ca/files/media.ruk.ca//nyt-1980-03-02-scan-20150820-173929.jpg\">July 2, 1978</a>. The <i>Times</i> was moving away from Linotype machines and on to the next level of typographic automation, where a new system used a hybrid of computerized storage and photographic reproduction techniques to set all the words in the daily newspaper.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00008.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The film was shot entirely in the New York Times building in midtown Manhattan, where production was vertically integrated, in this case lit­erally, as a series of stacked basements and sub-basements where type­setting, printing, bundling, and even distribution were handled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Daily production started from the editorial staff on the top floor and proceeded from one level down to the next, ending with delivery trucks pulling up to a loading dock and carting away bound papers for distribution.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00009.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>It’s useful to think about what these technical changes allowed for the distribution of news. What resulted from being able to set the paper so much more quickly? More editions per day? More money for reporting? Perhaps a rearrangement of physical space? Or more resources for long articles and also a broader range of quick-hit stories? Shifts in typographic technology inevitably provoke deep changes in what can be said, how it is printed, and what effects these printed words have in the world.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00007.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The film is approximately 30 minutes.

He worked in Germany, England, and the United States.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/265276\">This portrait</a> from 1926 maybe reveals something of Moholy’s disposition. He’s wearing a workman’s jumpsuit over a dress shirt and tie, looking like a hybrid worker-technocrat. He oriented himself more as a designer than an artist, although the distinction was fuzzy. He looks rather austere, but wasn’t—his friends called him “Holy Mahogany.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moholy was interested in photography. It was relatively new at the time and he recognized it as a contemporary way to make images. His photographic experiments often pushed at the edges of the medium. He exaggerated perspective and used unexpected vantage points to abstract the subjects he shot. He cut up prints and assembled collages. He gathered images into composites. And he made photograms. Here are two:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00011.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Photograms are images made directly from, or, in fact, by, an object. The object is placed directly on photo-sensitive paper and then the paper is exposed to light. The result is a contact print, a kind of light tracing. You might think of a photogram as seeing through an object to its essence. There’s a one-to-one directness to the print, where the object is reproduced at the same scale as the image made of it. The process is immediate and the result has an equally urgent quality. It is not dissimilar from printing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>American artist <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/3716\">Man Ray</a> developed the technique around the same time and he called them “rayographs.” Man Ray was born as Emmanuel Radnitzky, a Russian Jewish boy from South Philadelphia. He found his way to Paris, and made art. Lots of it. So, for example this is one of his photograms on the left. But he made many things other than rayographs, including poetry and even typography. I love this poster on the right which Man Ray designed for The London Underground in 1932, which seems to pick up a sentence mid-thought. It’s not a photogram, but who cares, it has something of that quality.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00038.jpg\"><br></div>\r\n\r\n<div><br></div><div>And even a good century before, British botanist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Atkins\">Anna Atkins</a> produced an extraordinary collection of photograms made with sunlight as cyanotypes of the different types of algae.

It must be understood that as long as art stands aside from the problems of life it will only interest a very few people. Culture today is becoming a mass affair and the artist must step down from his pedestal and be pre­pared to make a sign for the butcher shop if he knows how to do it. The artist must cast off the last rags of romanticism and become active, well up in present day techniques, materials, and working methods. Without losing his innate aesthetic sense he must be able to respond with humility and competence to the demands his neighbors may make of him. The designer of today re-establishes the long lost contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing.</blockquote><div>This appeared in the Milan daily newspaper, Il Giorno, where Munari wrote a regular column on design. The excerpt I read was from an article titled “Design as Art.” But he wasn’t always so earnest.

It’s organized as a guided tour of various sites on the campus of MIT, attempting to track 40 years of Cooper’s work across different departments within the university.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00015.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/muriel-cooper\">Muriel Cooper</a> always sought more responsive systems of design and production, emphasizing quicker feedback loops between thinking and making, often blurring the distinction between the two. OK, let’s go ahead and get started.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><blockquote>1. An accidental archive at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>We begin in a locked closet housing a collection of posters, documents, videotapes, and related printed matter which forms a de facto archive of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies. Embarking on a client-design relationship with the Center, I arrived in Cambridge to spend a few days going through the archive and examining its contents.</div><div><br></div><div>The Center for Advanced Visual studies was set up in 1967 by György Kepes as a fellowship program for artists. Initiated with considerable institutional and financial support, the Center produced artworks, exhibitions, and public programs that were often accompanied by a poster or publication. These posters provide an immediate, condensed, and visually legible accidental archive of its almost four-decade history.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00016.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>While working my way through the contents of the closet, I was struck immediately by the surface qualities of this extraordinary set of posters. It was not simply the graphic design nor the typography that caught me—rather it was their mode of production. The design of the posters changed sporadically as new designers or administrators appeared, but what remains the same is the way each self-consciously incorporates its production method into the design.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class . . .&nbsp;</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Readings<div><a href=\"media/pdf/Visible-Wisdom.pdf\">Visible-Wisdom.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Janet Abrams)<div><a href=\"/media/pdf/The-New-Graphic-Languages.pdf\">The New Graphic Languages.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Muriel Cooper)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/muriel-cooper\">Muriel Cooper (MIT Press)</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhrZHkdc2rU\">Information Landscapes</a></div></div><div><a href=\"/media/txt/The-New-Graphic-Languages.txt\">The New Graphic Languages.txt</a><br></div>'),(10,1,'2020-08-10 20:29:51','2021-08-16 15:08:29',NULL,'November 15',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'november-15',NULL,'2021-11-15 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Ground Writing',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>The message came from about halfway around the world, from some friends I met last summer who were now busy organizing a large group of people.

They were mostly older men but not exclusively. One woman I remembered in particular because <a href=\"https://www.are.na/block/5853275\">she held brushes in both hands and wrote two columns of mirrored calligraphy at the same time</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Water calligraphy, better known as Ground Writing or 地书 (Pinyin “Dishu”) in Chinese, appeared at the start of the 1980s in Beijing. This was around the time of the “Reform and Opening Up” policy and since then ground writing has spread to public parks all over China. The calligraphers write poetry, mostly short traditional verse. Most of them are retired. One 79-year-old described to me,</div><div><br></div><blockquote>“This is just for fun! You have to do something when you get old right?”&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>They use <a href=\"https://www.are.na/block/5853292\">homemade brushes fashioned from broomsticks</a> and hand-cut brushes made from sponges, rags, mops, whatever they can find. They write directly on the ground, in public space.

I was fascinated by the ritualized order in which the strokes that define any character were drawn. I later understood that stroke order is essential in Chinese writing—a different order would suggest a different character. Nearby, newspapers hung for public reading. The proximity, even overlap, of reading and writing in this public space made a strong impression on me and I recalled the story of British Romantic poet John Keats who died young and asked to be buried in an unidentified grave marked only by the epitaph:</div><div><br></div><blockquote>Here lies One Whose Name was Writ in Water.&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>All writing should be done like that.

He also suggested a typographic path not taken. This was how he began his Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture at the American Mathematical Society on July 4, 1978:</div><div><br></div><blockquote>I will be speaking today about work-in-progress instead of completed research. This was not my original intention when I chose the subject of this lecture, but the fact is I couldn’t get my computer programs working in time. Fortunately, it is just as well that I don’t have a finished product to describe to you today because research in mathematics is generally much more interesting while you’re doing it then after it’s all done.</blockquote><div><br></div><div>It’s a prestigious lecture awarded annually for individual contributions to applied mathematics and when Knuth faced the room of mathematicians assembled in Providence, Rhode Island, he proceeded to talk not about math, but instead about typography. He began by showing slides, one after the other, pages from <i>Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i> illustrating how its composition and typography has changed over the last 100 years. For example, he showed this page from 1922 and pointed to its sharp modern serif type.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00020.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>These were typographic fine points likely lost on his audience. But he had a reason, or an agenda anyway. He was showing these because he was upset by how the journal looked now. The <i>Bulletin</i> had switched to phototypesetting and Knuth found the result so (typographically) poor, that he refused to publish his work in it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00019.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Knuth talked not just about the typography in the journals, but also about a project he was working on to improve the prospects for digital typesetting. The <a href=\"http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~millerpd/docs/501_Winter13/Knuth79.pdf\">“work-in-progress”</a> he alluded to at the start of the talk, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX\">a new digital typesetting system</a>, continued for the next 10 years.

Writer, typographer, printer, publisher, politician, inventor, statesman, gentleman scientist, linguist, librarian, and the first Postmaster General of the United States, Franklin was the consummate networker. Distributing his ideas far and wide through a dizzying range of practices, he established a network of printing franchises by sending former apprentices to set up shop in new towns and collecting dues. He traveled extensively to London and to the courts of France, fostering alliances that helped form a nation. He wrote incisive arguments and entertainments under a &nbsp;constellation of pseudonyms including the Casuist, Silence Dogood, Busy-Body, Poor Richard, and J. T. to suit the purpose at hand. He advocated for a paper currency to facilitate the liberal distribution of goods and services while he was also a printer and so stood to make money by printing the paper currency which he lobbied for! He was often working both sides of the equation and I think this compromised quality is what I like about this familiar engraving—his almost-smirk.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00006.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>He published a weekly newspaper, an occasional magazine, and the annual <i>Poor Richard’s Almanack</i>. Along the way, Franklin pursued his polymathic interests, inventing (a partial list): the medical catheter, the armonica (a musical instrument), a phonetic alphabet, the circulating stove, swim fins, binoculars, and the lightning rod. He founded the first public lending library, a volunteer fire department, the American Philosophical Society, a university, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States. He was a committed generalist.</div><div><br></div><div>. . .</div><div><br></div><div>Beatrice Warde also used her frontline position in typography as a gateway to injecting her voice into a wider conversation through her writing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00005.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Warde was born in New York City in 1900. Her father was an experimental musician from Germany who developed a chromatic alphabet. Her mother was May Lamberton Becker, a columnist at the New York Herald Tribune at the turn of the 20th century. Beatrice was often involved in &nbsp;her mother’s work at the Herald Tribune, so she had an early appreciation for letters, for typography, for writing, and for editing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>After homeschooling until age twelve, Warde was sent to Horace Mann School, a progressive academy in New York City.

try conducting the discovery procedure using writing; I\'d display words on the screen, and use the camera to record the words they write. I\'m hoping the heptapods will do the same.\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div>It\'s a strange semester, yes. We\'re remote. We meet each other through this screen where you find me right *now.* Our current reality might pass for science fiction, so perhaps it is a good time to read some, together.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life\">Story of Your Life</a></i> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang\">Ted Chiang</a> would be a good choice. It’s brief and complicated. It’s visual. It’s even typographical. You might already know the plot from its film adaptation in 2016 starring Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)\">Arrival</a></i>. Meanwhile, our story continues.</div><div><br></div><blockquote>Weber looked at the drawing dubiously. \"What would be the advantage of that?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"So far I\'ve been proceeding the way I would with speakers of an unwritten language. Then it occurred to me that the heptapods must have writing, too.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"So?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"If the heptapods have a mechanical way of producing writing, then their writing ought to be very regular, very consistent. That would make it easier for us to identify graphemes instead of phonemes. It\'s like picking out the letters in a printed sentence instead of trying to hear them when the sentence is spoken aloud.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"I take your point,\" he admitted. \"And how would you respond to them? Show them the words they displayed to you?\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div>“Graphemes”? “Phonemes”? Sounds like typography to me. And in fact it is—the story proceeds as a kind of typographic detective story, but instead of whodunnit, this one’s a howdtheydoit. We find out quickly enough that the Heptapods do indeed have a writing system and they also have a spoken language. Here’s a scene from early in the film version when Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) first witnesses the strange handwriting:</div><div><br></div><div>\r\n\r\n<video width=\"100%\" controls=\"\">\r\n  <source src=\"media/00034.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video>\r\n\r\n</div><div><br></div><div>She also records their extraterrestrial voices, and deduces a way to proceed based on a correlation between the two.</div><div><br></div><blockquote>\"Basically. And if they put spaces between words, any sentences we write would be a lot more intelligible than any spoken sentence we might splice together from recordings.\"</blockquote><blockquote>He leaned back in his chair. \"You know we want to show as little of our technology as possible.\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div>Surely.</div><div><br></div><blockquote>\"I understand, but we\'re using machines as intermediaries already. If we can get them to use writing, I believe progress will go much faster than if we\'re restricted to the sound spectrographs.\"</blockquote><blockquote>The colonel turned to Gary. \"Your opinion?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"It sounds like a good idea to me. I\'m curious whether the heptapods might have difficulty reading our monitors. Their looking glasses are based on a completely different technology than our video screens. As far as we can tell, they don\'t use pixels or scan lines, and they don\'t refresh on a frame-by-frame basis.\"</blockquote><div><div><br></div><div>This is an imaginary, or anyway, *conjured* set of digits produced by harnessing a neural network to <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\">a large database of handwritten numbers</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00032.gif\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The glyphs above were never written, but rather they’ve been inferred by a computer program trained to the task.

Writer, typographer, printer, publisher, politician, inventor, statesman, gentleman scientist, linguist, librarian, and the first Postmaster General of the United States, Franklin was the consummate networker. Distributing his ideas far and wide through a dizzying range of practices, he established a network of printing franchises by sending former apprentices to set up shop in new towns and collecting dues. He traveled extensively to London and to the courts of France, fostering alliances that helped form a nation. He wrote incisive arguments and entertainments under a &nbsp;constellation of pseudonyms including the Casuist, Silence Dogood, Busy-Body, Poor Richard, and J. T. to suit the purpose at hand. He advocated for a paper currency to facilitate the liberal distribution of goods and services while he was also a printer and so stood to make money by printing the paper currency which he lobbied for! He was often working both sides of the equation and I think this compromised quality is what I like about this familiar engraving—his almost-smirk.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00006.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>He published a weekly newspaper, an occasional magazine, and the annual <i>Poor Richard’s Almanack</i>. Along the way, Franklin pursued his polymathic interests, inventing (a partial list): the medical catheter, the armonica (a musical instrument), a phonetic alphabet, the circulating stove, swim fins, binoculars, and the lightning rod. He founded the first public lending library, a volunteer fire department, the American Philosophical Society, a university, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States. He was a committed generalist.</div><div><br></div><div>. . .</div><div><br></div><div>Beatrice Warde also used her frontline position in typography as a gateway to injecting her voice into a wider conversation through her writing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00005.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Warde was born in New York City in 1900.

It evolved through several stages, none of which ever really stuck. <i>Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu</i>, a film directed by David Loeb Weiss, captures one moment in this transition by chronicling the last day of metal typesetting at the <i>New York Times</i> on <a href=\"https://ruk.ca/sites/ruk.ca/files/media.ruk.ca//nyt-1980-03-02-scan-20150820-173929.jpg\">July 2, 1978</a>. The <i>Times</i> was moving away from Linotype machines and on to the next level of typographic automation, where a new system used a hybrid of computerized storage and photographic reproduction techniques to set all the words in the daily newspaper.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00008.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The film was shot entirely in the New York Times building in midtown Manhattan, where production was vertically integrated, in this case lit­erally, as a series of stacked basements and sub-basements where type­setting, printing, bundling, and even distribution were handled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Daily production started from the editorial staff on the top floor and proceeded from one level down to the next, ending with delivery trucks pulling up to a loading dock and carting away bound papers for distribution.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00009.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>It’s useful to think about what these technical changes allowed for the distribution of news.

He worked in Germany, England, and the United States.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/265276\">This portrait</a> from 1926 maybe reveals something of Moholy’s disposition. He’s wearing a workman’s jumpsuit over a dress shirt and tie, looking like a hybrid worker-technocrat. He oriented himself more as a designer than an artist, although the distinction was fuzzy. He looks rather austere, but wasn’t—his friends called him “Holy Mahogany.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moholy was interested in photography. It was relatively new at the time and he recognized it as a contemporary way to make images. His photographic experiments often pushed at the edges of the medium. He exaggerated perspective and used unexpected vantage points to abstract the subjects he shot. He cut up prints and assembled collages. He gathered images into composites. And he made photograms. Here are two:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00011.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Photograms are images made directly from, or, in fact, by, an object. The object is placed directly on photo-sensitive paper and then the paper is exposed to light. The result is a contact print, a kind of light tracing. You might think of a photogram as seeing through an object to its essence. There’s a one-to-one directness to the print, where the object is reproduced at the same scale as the image made of it. The process is immediate and the result has an equally urgent quality. It is not dissimilar from printing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>American artist <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/3716\">Man Ray</a> developed the technique around the same time and he called them “rayographs.” Man Ray was born as Emmanuel Radnitzky, a Russian Jewish boy from South Philadelphia. He found his way to Paris, and made art. Lots of it. So, for example this is one of his photograms on the left. But he made many things other than rayographs, including poetry and even typography.

It must be understood that as long as art stands aside from the problems of life it will only interest a very few people. Culture today is becoming a mass affair and the artist must step down from his pedestal and be pre­pared to make a sign for the butcher shop if he knows how to do it. The artist must cast off the last rags of romanticism and become active, well up in present day techniques, materials, and working methods. Without losing his innate aesthetic sense he must be able to respond with humility and competence to the demands his neighbors may make of him. The designer of today re-establishes the long lost contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing.</blockquote><div>This appeared in the Milan daily newspaper, Il Giorno, where Munari wrote a regular column on design. The excerpt I read was from an article titled “Design as Art.” But he wasn’t always so earnest.

An accidental archive at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>We begin in a locked closet housing a collection of posters, documents, videotapes, and related printed matter which forms a de facto archive of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies. Embarking on a client-design relationship with the Center, I arrived in Cambridge to spend a few days going through the archive and examining its contents.</div><div><br></div><div>The Center for Advanced Visual studies was set up in 1967 by György Kepes as a fellowship program for artists. Initiated with considerable institutional and financial support, the Center produced artworks, exhibitions, and public programs that were often accompanied by a poster or publication. These posters provide an immediate, condensed, and visually legible accidental archive of its almost four-decade history.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00016.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>While working my way through the contents of the closet, I was struck immediately by the surface qualities of this extraordinary set of posters. It was not simply the graphic design nor the typography that caught me—rather it was their mode of production. The design of the posters changed sporadically as new designers or administrators appeared, but what remains the same is the way each self-consciously incorporates its production method into the design.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class . . .&nbsp;</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Readings<div><a href=\"media/pdf/Visible-Wisdom.pdf\">Visible-Wisdom.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Janet Abrams)<div><a href=\"/media/pdf/The-New-Graphic-Languages.pdf\">The New Graphic Languages.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Muriel Cooper)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/muriel-cooper\">Muriel Cooper (MIT Press)</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhrZHkdc2rU\">Information Landscapes</a></div></div><div><a href=\"/media/txt/The-New-Graphic-Languages.txt\">The New Graphic Languages.txt</a><br></div>'),(24,1,'2020-08-10 20:29:51','2021-08-16 15:01:32',NULL,'November 2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'november-2',NULL,'2020-11-02 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Ground Writing',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>The message came from about halfway around the world, from some friends I met last summer who were now busy organizing a large group of people.

This was around the time of the “Reform and Opening Up” policy and since then ground writing has spread to public parks all over China. The calligraphers write poetry, mostly short traditional verse. Most of them are retired. One 79-year-old described to me,</div><div><br></div><blockquote>“This is just for fun! You have to do something when you get old right?”&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>They use <a href=\"https://www.are.na/block/5853292\">homemade brushes fashioned from broomsticks</a> and hand-cut brushes made from sponges, rags, mops, whatever they can find.

I was fascinated by the ritualized order in which the strokes that define any character were drawn. I later understood that stroke order is essential in Chinese writing—a different order would suggest a different character. Nearby, newspapers hung for public reading. The proximity, even overlap, of reading and writing in this public space made a strong impression on me and I recalled the story of British Romantic poet John Keats who died young and asked to be buried in an unidentified grave marked only by the epitaph:</div><div><br></div><blockquote>Here lies One Whose Name was Writ in Water.&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>All writing should be done like that.

Clues to the meaning of the series are located in the individual works’ titles. For example, <i>EE (Generates / Giulio Paolini, Young man looking at Lorenzo Lotto, 1967)</i> (2008–2009) reaches to both the late 1960s of Italian Arte Povera conceptualist Giulio Paolini and the late fifteenth-century Renaissance-to-Mannerist painter Lorenzo Lotto.</div><div><br></div><div>Poet Jena Osman recently described your layered text-image compositions as copies that “lovingly degrade the past in order to create a new lineage that can move into the future.” In an interview with curator Krist Gruijthuijsen you said, “My work cancels out any kind of autonomy . . . it much more concerns the connections between things that are often made disparate or have been disconnected.” It seems pretty clear that you’re trying to recompile history by creating a set of signs whose place in time is complicated.

He began by showing slides, one after the other, pages from <i>Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i> illustrating how its composition and typography has changed over the last 100 years. For example, he showed this page from 1922 and pointed to its sharp modern serif type.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00020.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>These were typographic fine points likely lost on his audience. But he had a reason, or an agenda anyway. He was showing these because he was upset by how the journal looked now. The <i>Bulletin</i> had switched to phototypesetting and Knuth found the result so (typographically) poor, that he refused to publish his work in it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00019.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Knuth talked not just about the typography in the journals, but also about a project he was working on to improve the prospects for digital typesetting. The <a href=\"http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~millerpd/docs/501_Winter13/Knuth79.pdf\">“work-in-progress”</a> he alluded to at the start of the talk, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX\">a new digital typesetting system</a>, continued for the next 10 years. He discussed a few specific problems along the way in precisely describing subtle curves in the shapes of letters.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class . . .</a>&nbsp;</div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Readings<div><a href=\"media/pdf/A-Note-on-the-Type.pdf\">A-Note-on-the-Type.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Dexter Sinister)</div><div><div><a href=\"media/pdf/Designing-Programmes.pdf\">Designing-Programmes.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Karl Gerstner)</div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/\">Don Knuth’s homepage</a></div><div><a href=\"media/pdf/Mathematical-Typography.pdf\">Mathematical-Typography.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Donald Knuth)</div></div><div><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/444353264\">Prem Krishnamurthy, Commune, v1.0.0</a></div><div><a href=\"http://coopertype.org/event/thirty_two_years_of_metafont\">Thirty-two Years of Metafont (Donald Knuth)</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koc5MDoGW8U\">Mathematical Typography (David Reinfurt)</a></div><div><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/65248695\">Letter &amp; Spirit</a></div><div><br></div><div>Visitor</div><div>Prem Krishnamurthy</div><div><a href=\"http://k-komma.de/\">http://k-komma.de/</a><br></div><div><a href=\"http://p-exclamation.com/\">http://p-exclamation.com/</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>On Kawara</div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/video/on-kawara-date-paintings\">https://www.guggenheim.org/video/on-kawara-date-paintings</a><br></div><div><a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/on-kawara-silence\">https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/on-kawara-silence</a><br></div><div><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/arts/design/the-guggenheim-shows-first-on-kawara-retrospective.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/arts/design/the-guggenheim-shows-first-on-kawara-retrospective.html</a></div></div>'),(27,1,'2020-08-10 20:28:39','2021-08-16 15:02:25',NULL,'November 23',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'november-23',NULL,'2020-11-23 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Final',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Here’s a diagram from William James’ 1890 book, <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>:<div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00033.gif\"><br></div><div>The drawing makes concrete what has been implied all semester: reading and writing are intimately connected through the *specific* shapes of the letters.

Students learn typographic history through lectures that highlight major shifts in print technologies. Class readings provide the raw material for a sequence of hands-on typesetting exercises which punctuate the class weekly. Metal letterpess typesetting, photo-typesetting, and digital typesetting will be covered through online demonstration sessions. This semester online, the class will also further explore the typographic future by engaging and designing novel electronic text entry interfaces and decoding a fictional alien typography.</blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"/print\">Print syllabus</a> / <a href=\"/read\">Download readings</a></blockquote>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><br></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								');
